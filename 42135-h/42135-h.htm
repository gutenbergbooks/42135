<h1>THE UNWILLING<br />
PROFESSOR</h1>

<p class="center">by Arthur Porges</p>

<p class="center"><i>illustrated by Milton Luros</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On that fateful afternoon
Fatty Schultz and Irv Lece had
cut their last classes, and were
taking a gloomy walk together, scrambling
through the scrubby brush well
behind the athletic field.</p>

<p>There were good reasons for their
unhappiness. Fatty was failing in
Calculus II with a velocity that varied
directly as the square of the number
of lectures attended. Irv's math instructor
had informed <i>him</i>, with a kind
of loathing respect, that his only salvation
lay in recommencing the study
of arithmetic&mdash;taking five or ten years
in the process&mdash;and then retiring to
a cave for perhaps another fifteen in
the vain hope of digesting, through
meditation and prayer, the multiplication
table. After that, Irv might be
ready for elementary algebra, but not,
the professor hoped to a merciful God,
in this unfortunate institution of higher
learning.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the whole of
their fraternity, Omega Pi Upsilon
(usually referred to on campus as
"Oh, P-Yu") was in the same boat
regarding almost every subject offered
at Bateman College. Bateman had
courses that ranged from Aardvark
Breeding to Zythum Brewing, but no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
field of knowledge troubled them more
than mathematics.</p>

<p>Hence the long face on Irv Lece.
Fatty's visage also strove to elongate,
but simply wasn't built for such an
accomplishment. Instead, his piggy little
eyes, ordinarily glowing with a kind
of coarse good-humor, were now
smouldering with resentment.</p>

<p>They had just seated themselves
in a small clearing, where Fatty, after
setting his calculus text on a grassy
mound, began to heave rocks at it,
when there was a whistling scream, a
jarring <i>whump</i>, and before their bulging
eyes a small disc lay crumpled,
barely ten yards away.</p>

<p>A shrill creaking came from this
odd craft, which looked like a manhole-cover
some eight feet in diameter
and twenty inches thick. Then, as they
stared in wonder, a badly-sprung
port opened crazily, and a small rabbit
flopped out. It may be stated here
that the creature was not actually a
rabbit, but that any difference between
the disc's pilot and an ordinary cottontail
was imperceptible to the naked
eye.</p>

<p>For a moment the rabbit swayed
drunkenly, its big eyes cloudy, then
it hopped towards Fatty, preferring,
perhaps, his larger gravitational field
over Irv's. Extending one snowy paw,
it squeaked: "Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Permit me to introduce myself.
I am a good-will ambassador from
Venus, and by your conventions
should be addressed as 'Professor.'
My name," he added a trifle pompously,
"is Iglowt P. Slakmak, and
I hold degrees comparable to your
PhD, LLD, and M. D." All this in a
very British accent.</p>

<p>Fatty gave a hoarse croak; Irv's
knees knocked together.</p>

<p>"Come," the rabbit chirped, "chin
up, fellows! There's nothing to be
afraid of. I speak English because
we've been monitoring your radio
broadcasts for years. Television is a
bit trickier, but we've seen a few. And
by listening to educational programs,
I've learned a great deal about terrestrial
culture, which I notice is
based upon cigarettes, used cars&mdash;but
never mind that, now. I must get to
Washington and present myself. A
rival of mine is about to contact
Mars for the first time, and I hope
to send in my report on Earth first."
He peered at them anxiously. "You
do understand me, chaps, don't you?
I learned the best English from
B. B. C., you know."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Seeing that the two boys were
still dumb, the rabbit, with a
mighty effort, picked up the three-pound
calculus text, which was bound
in a revolting green. As he did so, a
paper fluttered out, and the professor
deftly scooped it up. He studied Fatty's
messy scrawlings for a moment,
then said warmly: "Ah, I observe that
you chaps are beginning the study of
elementary mathematics." He shook
a paw waggishly. "The limits are
wrong on this integration: they should
go from pi-over-two to pi-over-three
first, instead of to zero. There's a
discontinuity at pi-over-three, and
your result, that the center of gravity
of this six-inch cube is nine feet
to the right, looks somewhat implausible."</p>

<p>At this, Fatty finally found his
voice. "A discontinuity?" he gulped.
"Whassat?"</p>

<p>"Aw, you know," Irv rebuked him.
"Old Cusp's been gassing about 'em
for days, now."</p>

<p>"Has he? Well, what is it, if you're
so smart?"</p>

<p>"I don't remember," Irv said brazenly,
"but at least I heard the name
before."</p>

<p>"At pi-over-three," the rabbit broke
in with authority, "the denominator
of the integrand vanishes. To put it
loosely, the function becomes infinite."</p>

<p>Fatty looked at Irv; Irv gaped at
Fatty. The piggy eyes lit up. "A rabbit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
that knows math!" Fatty breathed.</p>

<p>"Knows it! He wrote the damn
book&mdash;a real brain!" Irv exulted.</p>

<p>Once again their eyes met meaningly.
"You always said," Irv remarked
in an abstracted manner, "that you
could lick the guy who invented
calc."</p>

<p>"I sure can," Fatty asserted,
"but&mdash;" He paused; then with a
speed surprising in one of his bulk,
his thick hands shot out, and Professor
Slakmak, the eminent Venusian savant,
found himself dangling by the
ears from stubby, freckled fingers.
He kicked with a vigor shockingly
undignified.</p>

<p>"Let me down!" he squeaked furiously.
"This is outrageous. A friendly
ambassador's person is sacred
among all civilized peoples; your national
President shall hear of this insult!"</p>

<p>Fatty looked at him, showing uneven
teeth in a loose grin. "Bugs Bunny,"
he gloated, "you are now the official
mascot of Omega Pi Upsilen!"</p>

<p>"I second the motion," Irv said,
shuffling in excitement.</p>

<p>"We'd better hide his ship, though,"
Fatty cried, full of ingenious intelligence
now that nobody was grading
him for it.</p>

<p>"It's too big, ain't it?" Irv replied
doubtfully. "Simmer down you!" he
ordered the writhing professor. "We
don't wanna choke you, but&mdash;" The
captive subsided, contenting himself
with little quivers of indignation.</p>

<p>"It's awful light," Fatty muttered,
shoving the damaged saucer with one
size eleven shoe. "We'll move it over
here, pile a lot of brush on top,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;Start a fire!" Irv interrupted
joyously.</p>

<p>The professor gave a piercing
squeal of protest.</p>

<p>"No, stupid," Fatty told him, winking.
"If the prof here helps us out
this semester, we'll give him back his
old disc, right?"</p>

<p>"Right," Irv agreed, crossing two
fingers.</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes, even with Fatty
working one-handed, the ship vanished
under a pile of stiff brush.
"That's that," Irv said, taking a deep
breath. "Now&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We can't take him like this," Fatty
remarked, swinging the professor
by his ears and giving him a shake by
way of emphasis.</p>

<p>"Why not? We just been rabbit-hunting,
that's all."</p>

<p>"Too risky. Even if the professor
keeps quiet, some joker from another
frat might get nosy."</p>

<p>"He'll be quiet," Irv said grimly.
"I know how to hit a rabbit on the
neck with the edge of my hand&mdash;"
Here the professor began to kick frantically,
and Fatty snatched his hind
legs, holding him rigid from ears to
toes.</p>

<p>"There's an old cardboard box
back there," Fatty said. "That'll do
the trick."</p>

<p>A few seconds later the sullen captive
was stuffed unceremoniously into
a damp, mouldy container, and the
two students returned to the campus,
their hearts free from mathematical
worries.</p>

<p>"The frat will owe us plenty for
this," Fatty said darkly. "We've never
had anybody to coach us in math."</p>

<p>"They'll be licking our boots," Irv
agreed. "But they always have, the
poor dopes!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night the professor, poorly
refreshed by some wilted carrot
tops and water, found himself in a
circle of eager Omega Pi Upsilon's,
delivering a detailed lecture&mdash;mostly
problem-solving&mdash;on Section 45 of
Broota's "Introduction to the Elementary
Rudiments of the Differential
and Integral Calculus."</p>

<p>He was a good teacher, and when
either his enthusiasm or expository art
faltered, Fatty revived it quickly with
a sharp pinch or stinging slap. So,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
although the average I. Q. of the fraternity
was seventy-six, a certain
amount of mathematics get through;
and it was almost midnight before the
unhappy ambassador found himself
lying in a dirty, fetid cage, formerly
the residence of the fraternity parrot,
who had expired for lack of intellegent
dialogue to copy. Rabbits, even
Venusian ones, cannot weep, but the
professor's soul was heavy within him.</p>

<p>And so it went, day after day,
week after week.</p>

<p>"I am quite amazed," Professor
Cusp told a skeptical colleague towards
the end of the term, "at the
remarkable way Schultz and his Oh
P-Yu bunch have improved. Their
homework these last six weeks has
been excellent."</p>

<p>"Somebody's coaching them&mdash;or
doing it outright," was the cynical reply.
"I find no improvement in their
zoology."</p>

<p>"No, that's what I suspected at
first, but it can't be true. For example,
on last week's extra credit problem&mdash;a
real stinker&mdash;they turned in over
a dozen correct solutions, all different.
Nobody would go to that much
trouble for the P-Yu crowd; they're
about as popular on campus as Malenkov
is with the D. A. R."</p>

<p>Another colleague, who had been
listening, demanded: "But you won't
let Fatty Schultz by, will you?"</p>

<p>"I'll have to," Cusp admitted. "Even
though his exams are still horrible, I
give quite a bit of weight to good
homework, so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You swine!" the other said sourly.
"Now I'll get him."</p>

<p>Cusp laughed. "Ah, but you're supposed
to be tough; they're afraid of
you."</p>

<p>"They'd better be. It's a pity the
biology lab has to experiment on poor
chimps while we give degrees to
anthropoids like Fatty!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night Fatty told his unwilling
mascot the bad news. "I'm
sorry, Prof," he said genially. "It's
only one more term, then I'll be done
with math, and you can go back to
your disc. By my last course is with
old Totient, and he's rough."</p>

<p>"You promised!" the professor
squealed angrily.</p>

<p>"This time I mean it, honest."</p>

<p>"Hey, Fatty," a fraternity brother
objected, "ain't you gonna leave the
prof to our gang? Just cause <i>you're</i>
through&mdash;" He broke off in confusion
as Irv kicked his ankle, hard.</p>

<p>"Ignore the jerk," Lece reassured
the crestfallen rabbit. "When Fatty
and I finish our math requirement,
you're on your own again. Course,
you'll have to promise not to tell the
President!" Over the professor's head
he winked broadly at his friends.</p>

<p>"I won't do it! It's a cad's trick!"
The rabbit's brown eyes were bright
with rage.</p>

<p>Fatty pawed his soft fur with one
lardy hand. "C'mon, Prof, be a sport,"
he urged, greasily affectionate. "We
like you a lot. You wouldn't let us
down now."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;will&mdash;not&mdash;do&mdash;it! You promised&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will, too!" Irv grunted.
"Don't give us any backtalk. If I have
to twist your ears&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Use the cigarette lighter," somebody
suggested, half ashamed. "He's
only bluffing again."</p>

<p>"I'm not," the professor said sturdily.
"You can burn me, kill me, but I
won't tutor this bunch of cretins any
more!"</p>

<p>"Where does he get those words?"
a student wondered aloud. "What's a
cretin?"</p>

<p>"Irv," Fatty said in a sly, buttery
voice, "where's that nasty pooch who
adopted the Delts last week? The one
that chased the chaplain into Tom
Paine Hall. I'll bet he's a first class
abbitray oundhay."</p>

<p class="p4b">"Mac," Irv addressed a slender,
dark boy, "they keep him in that shed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
by the athletic field. Go and&mdash;ah borrow
him, will you?" Mac left.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/png_053i.png" width="173" height="250" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="p4t">"What's an abbitray oundhay?"
the professor quavered.</p>

<p>"You'll find out!" Fatty told him
grimly. "Don't they teach pig-latin on
Venus?"</p>

<p>There was a strained silence, while
some members of the group whispered
protests. But there was no open resistance.
Fatty and Irv ran Omega Phi
Upsilon with an iron hand.</p>

<p>Then the door opened, and Mac,
tugging hard at the collar of a large
dog, lurched into the room. "Here's
Hotspur," he grinned, as the brute
strove to mangle the cowering professor.</p>

<p>Hotspur was a canine melting pot.
The Spitz in his ancestry seemed to
predominate, but there were plain
traces of airdale, setter&mdash;and crowning
evidence of some mis-alliance&mdash;dachshund.
White teeth bared in a
slavering snarl, the dog glared at the
rabbit, lunging against his collar as
Mac held hard.</p>

<p>But the professor had collapsed, all
his courage gone. "A dog!" he gasped
in horror, and Hotspur seemed startled
at the human voice emerging
from a rabbit. A thin whimper came
from the professor. "Take that monster
away," he begged. "I'll do anything&mdash;anything!"</p>

<p>"That's better," Fatty chortled.
"But we need this good ol' hound more
than the Delts do. Put him down in
the basement&mdash;just in case." He eyed
the professor, who shrank into a furry,
abject heap.</p>

<p>"My new prof, Dr. Totient, is
tough," Fatty said. "Bugs Bunny here
is gonna have plenty to do. We'll
clear out now and let him prepare
his assignments! See that you watch
those signs," he jibed, handing out
what he had so long received. He
fastened the rabbit's chain to its
stout staple in the wall. "Here." He
fished an apple core from his jeans,
and tossed it at the professor, giving
him an oily smirk. "Just to show
there's no hard feeling. Eat hearty!"
He stumped out, followed by his companions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Gradually it grew dark, and
the deserted fraternity-house was
quiet. Ravenous, the professor finally
nerved himself to nibble the apple
core, which to his sensitive nostrils
reeked of Fatty. He had just downed
the last noisome fragment, when there
was a loud, inquisitive sniff at the
door. He grew rigid. Another sniff
and the shoulder thrust of a heavy
body.</p>

<p>Insecurely shut, the door swung
open, and a huge, white form stalked
in. The professor cringed, moaning
a little, the hot alien scent of dog in
his nose, prepared to meet a terrible
death.</p>

<p>"Ssst!" the big mongrel admonished
him. "I'm a friend," he rumbled in
slow, thick English. Trotting over, he
took the slender chain in his great
teeth, and threw his thirty pound body
into the wrench. The staple pulled free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's get t'hell out of here," he
grunted, "while your bunch is gone."</p>

<p>"B-but my ship," the professor
stammered, staring in bewilderment.
"It's broken down, and those two awful
boys will find me before I can fix
it."</p>

<p>"Never mind; I'll give you a lift
in mine. I'm heading for Washington,
then I'll have to report back on Mars.
I can drop you either place. I just
got word myself, only a few days ago,
that our two planets had finally made
contact. They asked me to find out
where you'd disappeared to, but I
never dreamed you were here. When
I heard you talking English&mdash;! But
we'd better scoot. I've spied out this
place long enough&mdash; I don't think it's
quite representative."</p>

<p>They had just reached the brush
behind the library, where the professor's
passionate story was completed,
when Hotspur, looking back, saw
lights flash in the fraternity house
windows.</p>

<p>"Wait here," he said cryptically.
"Be right back." He sprang into the
brush, and vanished. A few moments
later, the anxious professor heard
some yells of agony coming from the
campus, and before long Hotspur returned,
panting.</p>

<p>"I know you'll get a sympathetic
hearing in Washington," he gasped;
"and we Martians abhor violence, but
there are times&mdash;" He rubbed one paw
against his mouth. "I didn't like the
taste of Irv, but Fatty's even worse!
I hope," he added viciously, "they
have to take Pasteur treatments!"</p>

<p>"Me too!" Professor Slakmak
agreed cheerfully. "And best of all,
they'll flunk math&mdash;but good!
Where's your ship&mdash;Pal?"</p>
